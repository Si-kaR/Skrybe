# # The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# # A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

#   #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  assets:
    - assets/images/

#   # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
#   # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

#   # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
#   # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
#   # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
#   # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
#   # example:
#   # fonts:
#   #   - family: Schyler
#   #     fonts:
#   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
#   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
